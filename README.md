# Port-Scanner

This repository features a Python-based port scanning script that leverages the python-nmap library to identify open ports on a target machine.
This script is designed to assist with network diagnostics and security assessments by providing detailed port and service information.
This project includes a Python script for performing network port scans using the nmap tool. 
The script connects to a target machine, performs a scan to identify open ports and associated services, and displays the results. 
This tool is ideal for network administrators and security professionals who need to monitor and analyze network configurations.

**Features**:
- Port Scanning: Identifies open ports on a specified target machine.
- Service Detection: Uses the -sV option to determine the versions of the services running on open ports.
- Default Scripts: Utilizes -sC for running default Nmap scripts to gather additional information.
- Detailed Output: Provides a clear output of host information, protocols, and port states.

**Ethical Considerations**:
- Permission and Consent: Ensure you have explicit permission to scan the target machine. Unauthorized scanning is illegal and unethical.
- Responsible Use: Use this code responsibly and only for legitimate purposes, such as network diagnostics and security assessments within authorized environments.
- Legal Compliance: Comply with all relevant laws and regulations related to network scanning and security testing.
